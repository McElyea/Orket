# OS v1.2 Proposal Pack

Last updated: 2026-02-24
Status: Draft proposal (non-authoritative)

This folder normalizes the v1.2 idea dump from `docs/projects/ideas/Ideas.md` into a reviewable proposal set.

This pack is not authoritative until changes are accepted and promoted into:
1. `docs/projects/OS/contract-index.md`
2. `docs/projects/OS/contracts/*`
3. `docs/projects/OS/test-policy.md`

## Files
1. `contract-delta.md`: proposed contract/schema changes and scope.
2. `sovereign-laws.md`: proposed machine-testable law set.
3. `migration-matrix.md`: current -> proposed artifact mapping with break risk.
4. `implementation-plan.md`: phased implementation plan and PR slicing.
5. `open-decisions.md`: unresolved versioning/compatibility decisions.

## Review Order
1. `open-decisions.md`
2. `contract-delta.md`
3. `sovereign-laws.md`
4. `migration-matrix.md`
5. `implementation-plan.md`
