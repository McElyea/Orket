# Core Pillars Project

Date: 2026-02-24

## Purpose
Define and execute Orket's near-term product direction around functional pillars that solve immediate use cases without requiring OS-first scope.

10. `docs/projects/core-pillars/09-OFFLINE-CAPABILITY-MATRIX.md`
11. `docs/projects/core-pillars/10-WORKITEM-RUNTIME-REQUIREMENTS.md`
12. `docs/projects/core-pillars/11-WORKITEM-RUNTIME-IMPLEMENTATION-SLICES.md`

## Pillar Set
1. Application Scaffolding
2. API Generation
3. Deterministic Test Suites
4. Verified Refactoring
5. Runtime Model Replays
6. Local Sovereignty (Offline Mode)
7. Persistent Personality Bots
8. Integrated Vector Memory

## Dependency Rule
Engine-first modular contracts remain mandatory. New pillar delivery must comply with dependency direction and volatility boundary gates.
