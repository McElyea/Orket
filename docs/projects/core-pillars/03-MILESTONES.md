Canonical slice execution detail:
`docs/projects/core-pillars/08-DETAILED-SLICE-EXECUTION-PLAN.md`

## CP-1 (P1): Safety and API Vertical Slice
1. Land command transaction shell and safety contracts (`A1`, `A2`, `A4`) first.
2. Deliver `orket api add` for initial supported framework(s) on existing repos.
3. Deliver deterministic route test templates (template packs, not model-invented test structure).
4. Deliver minimal `orket init` blueprint hydration baseline.
5. Produce scaffold/API artifacts under retention policy.

## CP-2 (P2): Trust Vertical Slice
1. Deliver runtime replay schema and artifact recorder outputs.
2. Keep replay bounded to recording/comparison; no global policy-engine behavior.
3. Add deterministic replay drift gate.
4. Deliver verified refactor workflow with parity checks.
5. Integrate trust outputs into CI quality lane.
6. Deliver pre-execution failure-lesson advisory retrieval.

## CP-3 (P3): State and Sovereignty Vertical Slice
1. Integrate vector memory with deterministic retrieval contract.
2. Add persistent personality bot runtime profile controls.
3. Deliver offline capability matrix and enforced tests.
4. Validate end-to-end local-only run path.
5. Land Bucket D failure-lesson memory D1-D4 acceptance tests.

## Completion Definition
1. Each milestone ends with green `pytest` sweep and architecture gates.
2. Each milestone updates roadmap status and artifact links.
3. No milestone is complete without reproducible command-level runbook steps.
