# Card 006 - Replay Engine

## Scope
Define replay and run equivalence kernel APIs.

## Deliverables
1. Replay input/output contract.
2. Equivalence report structure.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Structural replay parity checks deterministic.
2. Divergences reported with stable codes.

## Test Gates
1. Equivalent fixture pair passes.
2. Divergent fixture pair fails with deterministic reason.

## Dependencies
Cards 002 and 005.

## Non-Goals
Semantic intent scoring.
