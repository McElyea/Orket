# Orket Roadmap

Last updated: 2026-02-21

## Canonical Roadmap Location
Active implementation sequencing has moved to:
`docs/implementation/PhasedRoadmap.md`

This file is intentionally minimal to reduce roadmap churn and noise.

## Roadmap Policy
1. Keep active and remaining execution work in `docs/implementation/PhasedRoadmap.md`.
2. Keep detailed program plans in `docs/implementation/*.md` only while active.
3. When a project is complete, move related plan/spec docs to `docs/archive/<ProjectName>/`.
4. Do not keep long completed sections in active roadmap files.
