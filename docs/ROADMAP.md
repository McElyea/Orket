# Orket Roadmap

Last updated: 2026-02-22

## Canonical Rule
`docs/ROADMAP.md` is the only active roadmap source.

## Process Source
All process and workflow rules live in `docs/CONTRIBUTOR.md`.

## Priority Now
1. `modularize`: finish Card 14 (sovereign logging hardening) and run final conformance gate.
2. `ideas`: hold as queued input backlog; no normative contract work until promoted.

## Project Index
Every non-archive project under `docs/projects/` must appear here.

| Project | Status | Priority | Canonical Path | Owner | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| modularize | active | P1 | `docs/projects/modularize/` | Orket Core | Complete Card 14, then run final conformance audit and close/archive if all gates pass. |
| ideas | queued | P2 | `docs/projects/ideas/` | Orket Core | Input backlog only; promote to active only after roadmap reprioritization. |
| archive | archive-root | n/a | `docs/projects/archive/` | Orket Core | Completed projects only. |
