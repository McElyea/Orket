# Orket Roadmap

Last updated: 2026-03-01

## Canonical Rule
`docs/ROADMAP.md` is the only active roadmap source.

## Process Source
All process and workflow rules live in `docs/CONTRIBUTOR.md`.

## Invocation Rule
If the user requests "follow roadmap" without naming a project, execute the highest-priority active (non-paused) item in **Priority Now**.
Current default target: none (no active projects).

## Priority Now
1. `resize` (completed): archived at `docs/projects/archive/Resize-2026-03-01/`.
2. `refactor` (completed): archived at `docs/projects/archive/Refactor-2026-03-01/`.
3. `RefactorCardEngine` (completed): archived at `docs/projects/archive/RefactorCardEngine-2026-02-28/`; contract spec retained at `docs/specs/WORKLOAD_CONTRACT_V1.md`.
