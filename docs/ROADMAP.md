# Orket Roadmap

Last updated: 2026-03-01

## Canonical Rule
`docs/ROADMAP.md` is the only active roadmap source.

## Process Source
All process and workflow rules live in `docs/CONTRIBUTOR.md`.

## Invocation Rule
If the user requests "follow roadmap" without naming a project, execute the highest-priority active (non-paused) item in **Priority Now**.
Current default target: TruthGate.

## Priority Now
1. TruthGate -- LLM-backed NPC responses with truth gate validation.

## Active Execution
1. TruthGate -- Implementation complete, testing and refinement.

## Project Index
Every non-archive project under `docs/projects/` must appear here.
