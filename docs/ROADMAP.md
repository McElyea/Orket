# Orket Roadmap

This roadmap tracks only unfinished work.
Architecture authority: `docs/OrketArchitectureModel.md`.

## Open Phases
1. None. All currently scheduled roadmap work is complete.

## Verification Baseline
1. `python -m pytest tests/ -q` -> 210 passed.
2. `python -m pytest --collect-only -q` -> 210 collected.

## Working Model

Use `Exists -> Working -> Done`:
1. Exists: item defined here with acceptance criteria.
2. Working: one active note in `Agents/HANDOFF.md`.
3. Done: verified and removed from roadmap with one `CHANGELOG.md` line.
