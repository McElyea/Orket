# Orket Roadmap

Last updated: 2026-02-21

## Canonical Roadmap Location
Active implementation sequencing has moved to:
`docs/implementation/PhasedRoadmap.md`

This file is intentionally minimal to reduce roadmap churn and noise.

## Roadmap Policy
1. Keep active and remaining execution work in `docs/implementation/PhasedRoadmap.md`.
2. Keep detailed program plans in `docs/implementation/*.md`.
3. Use git history for completed work; do not keep long completed sections here.
