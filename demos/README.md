# Demos

Small scripts that exercise isolated runtime behaviors.

## Included
1. `demos/priority.py`: card priority and dependency weighting examples.
2. `demos/wait_reason.py`: bottleneck/wait-reason examples.

## Run
```bash
python demos/priority.py
python demos/wait_reason.py
```

These demos are not operational benchmarks and are not used as release gates.
